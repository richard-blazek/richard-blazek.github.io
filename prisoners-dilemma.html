    <h1>Prisoner's dilemma</h1>
    <p>
      This simulation tries different strategies for playing the prisoner's
      dilemma. We play each pair of strategies against each other. For each
      pair, we do multiple rounds. In each round, the players know what their
      opponent did in the previous rounds and they have to make a decision
      for this round.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If both players cooperate &mdash; both get 3 points ("cooperation")
      </li>
      <li>
        If both players defect &mdash; both get 1 point ("conflict")
      </li>
      <li>
        One player cooperates, the other one defects &mdash; the first one
        gets 0 points ("sucker"), the other one gets 5 points ("temptation")
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Strategies tried in the simulation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Clever:</b> Starts by defecting, then cooperates for a few rounds,
        but later applies quirky conditional logic; mostly mimics the opponent's
        last move unless special patterns appear.
      </li>
      <li><b>Tolerant:</b> Cooperates unless the opponent defects twice in a row at some point.</li>
      <li><b>Agreeable:</b> Always cooperates.</li>
      <li><b>Averager:</b> Cooperates if the opponent has cooperated at least half the time overall.</li>
      <li><b>Crook:</b> Defects first, then cooperates only on even-numbered rounds if the opponent cooperated last
        time.</li>
      <li><b>EvilAvg:</b> Like Averager, but refuses to cooperate during the first two rounds.</li>
      <li><b>EvilNegative:</b> Cooperates only if the opponent defected last round.</li>
      <li><b>EvilTf2T:</b> Cooperates only if the opponent cooperated in at least one of the last two rounds, but not in
        the first two rounds.</li>
      <li><b>EvilTf1T:</b> Cooperates only if the opponent cooperated in the last round.</li>
      <li><b>FlipFlop:</b> Alternates strictly between defect and cooperate every round.</li>
      <li><b>Forgive0:</b> Cooperates only if the opponent has never defected.</li>
      <li><b>Forgive1:</b> Cooperates unless the opponent has defected more than once.</li>
      <li><b>Forgive2:</b> Cooperates unless the opponent has defected more than twice.</li>
      <li><b>Historic:</b> Cooperates unless the opponent defected on the second move.</li>
      <li><b>Negative:</b> Defects first, then always does the opposite of the opponent's last move.</li>
      <li><b>NiceAvg:</b> Like Averager, but always cooperates during the first two rounds.</li>
      <li><b>Evil:</b> Always defects.</li>
      <li><b>Provocateur:</b> Defects on the first move, then copies the opponent's previous move thereafter.</li>
      <li><b>Tf1t (Tit for Tat):</b> Cooperates first, then copies the opponent's last move.</li>
      <li><b>Tf2t (Tit for Two Tats):</b> Cooperates first, then defects only if the opponent defected twice in a row.
      </li>
      <li><b>Touchy:</b> Cooperates like Tf1t but only if the opponent has never defected twice in a row.</li>
    </ul>
